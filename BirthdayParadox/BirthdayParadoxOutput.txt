***Probability of at least two people having same birthday = P.A.T.P.H.S.B.***

	The experiment was performed 10000 times by taking group of 23 people on random basis,
	It was found that 5020 times at least 2 people were having birthday on same day
	And 4980 times no two people in the group were having birthday on same day.
	Thus By performing random experiment:PATPHSB= 0.502 ( 50.2 % )
	By using theory of probability,PATPHSB is:

	0.5072972343239854072254172283370325002359718452929878099019740020018841839181277159923316805370532012 ( 50.7297234324 % )

Enter the probability of 'at least two people with same birthday' you want:(Enter value between 0 to 1 )
0.441

When there are at least 21.0 people in group then probability of two people having same birthday is greater equal 44.100 %
