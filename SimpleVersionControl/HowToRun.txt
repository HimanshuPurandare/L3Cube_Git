* This document provides steps to 
  execute the 'SIMPLE VERSION CONTROL'

* Change the user to the 'root' user
  and run,
   # chmod +x svc
   # cp svc /usr/bin
   
* Sample execution
   Consider two files - test.txt and
   test2.txt
   
   test.txt contains:
   		Hello World
   		This is PICT
   		I'm using whatsapp
   		
   test2.txt contains:
   		Hey there!!!
   		Hi! How are you?
   		I'm fine. Wbu?
   		I'm good too.
   
  The following command is used to 
  save the current version	
  
   # svc [filename]
  
  eg.	
   # svc test.txt                     
   # svc test2.txt		
  
  Consider that we append a line to test.txt
  and delete line from test2.txt
  
  test.txt contains:
   		Hello World
   		This is PICT
   		I'm using whatsapp
   		I'm good too.
   		
   test2.txt contains:
   		Hey there!!!
   		Hi! How are you?
   		I'm fine. Wbu?
   		
   To save the newer versions,
   
   # svc test.txt                     
   # svc test2.txt			
   
   For retrieving particular version of the 
   file(Version numbers begin from 0),
   
   # svc [filename] [version_number]
   
   eg.
    # svc test.txt 1
    Hello World
	This is PICT
	I'm using whatsapp
	I'm good too.
   		
	# svc test2.txt 0
	Hey there!!!
   	Hi! How are you?
   	I'm fine. Wbu?
   	I'm good too.
